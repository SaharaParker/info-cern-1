# info-cern-1
This is my sample info cern project
I used the link: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp to figure out what the select tag is used for.
Then, I figured that I needed a label for that select tag.
Before I added my labels, I sampled the example from W3schools just to see how it would look on my page
I added the label tag so that it would show up next to the select tag. 
I entered the values for the three options. 
I also added a label for the text area. 
After deploying the committed version of my info-cern-1 repo to vercel, I realized I was unable to view the google.html page
I added /google.html to the end of the URL and it popped up. 
As a final touch, I added breaks after a few tags.
